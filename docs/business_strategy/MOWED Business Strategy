# MOWED Business Strategy

## Overview
MOWED (Mathematical Optimization With End-user Devices) is a project under bkhsoftware, committed to democratizing access to optimization tools. This strategy outlines how MOWED will maintain its mission while ensuring sustainability.

## Core Principles
1. Provide free access to basic optimization tools
2. Maintain control and keep operations small-scale
3. Generate enough income to cover costs and development time
4. Prioritize user value and education over profit

## Funding Model
The funding model is designed to support MOWED's development and maintenance while keeping the core product free.

### Primary Income Sources
1. Donations
   - Implement a "Buy me a coffee" or similar donation system
   - Clearly communicate how donations are used (e.g., server costs, development time)

2. Optional Paid Services (Future Consideration)
   - Cloud-based computation for complex problems
   - Custom module development
   - Consulting services for specialized optimization needs

### Secondary Considerations
1. Educational Outreach
   - Keep MOWED free for educational use to build goodwill and future user base
   - Consider offering specialized support or custom modules for educational institutions at a nominal fee

2. Patronage Program
   - Offer special recognition or early access to new features for regular supporters

## Implementation Timeline
1. Phase 1 (Current): Develop and release free core product
2. Phase 2: Implement donation system and clear communication about funding needs
3. Phase 3: Gradually introduce optional paid services as capabilities and demand grow

## Measuring Success
- User adoption and retention rates
- Donation frequency and amounts
- User feedback and testimonials, especially from educational users
- Ability to cover operational costs and fund ongoing development

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Insufficient income to cover costs
  Mitigation: Maintain low overhead, leverage free hosting options initially

- Risk: Balancing free offerings with paid services
  Mitigation: Clearly differentiate free and paid offerings, ensure core product remains valuable

## Review and Adaptation
This strategy will be reviewed bi-annually to ensure alignment with MOWED's mission and financial sustainability.
