# Local PWA Architecture for MOWED

## Current Architecture

Components:
1. HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend using Vue.js
2. Vite as the build tool and development server
3. Vuex for state management
4. Chart.js for data visualization
5. Service Workers for offline capabilities

How it works:
1. User visits the MOWED website
2. The browser downloads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
3. Service Worker caches necessary assets for offline use
4. When the user inputs data and clicks "Optimize":
   - The optimization logic (in JavaScript) performs the calculations
   - Results are stored in Vuex state and displayed using Vue components
   - Visualization is handled by Chart.js

Data Storage:
- LocalStorage for small data sets and app state
- IndexedDB for larger data sets and complex structures

## Future P2P Integration Considerations

To prepare for future integration with CosmicSyncCore, we are implementing the following design patterns:

1. Data Abstraction Layer:
   - Implement a generic data access interface that can be easily swapped out
   - Use adapters for different storage mechanisms (local storage, IndexedDB, future P2P storage)

2. Modular Optimization Engine:
   - Design optimization algorithms as separate modules
   - Implement a plugin system for easy addition of new optimization techniques

3. Asynchronous Computation Model:
   - Design optimization processes to work asynchronously
   - Prepare for potential offloading of computations to other peers

4. Robust State Management:
   - Implement a state management system that can handle distributed data
   - Prepare for eventual consistency models in a P2P environment

5. Conflict Resolution Strategies:
   - Implement basic conflict resolution for local data
   - Design data structures with conflict resolution in mind for future P2P sync

These considerations will allow for easier integration with CosmicSyncCore in the future, enabling features like distributed computing and peer-to-peer data sharing.

## Challenges and Considerations

- Balancing current simplicity with future extensibility
- Ensuring smooth transition from local-only to P2P architecture
- Maintaining performance across different devices and network conditions
- Securing user data in preparation for future P2P sharing capabilities

By implementing these architectural considerations, we're setting the foundation for MOWED to evolve into a powerful, distributed optimization platform while still delivering immediate value as a standalone PWA.
