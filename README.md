MOWED - Mathematical Optimization With End-user Devices

Description
MOWED is a web-based tool for reforestation optimization. It allows users to input various parameters and constraints to determine the optimal mix of tree species for reforestation projects.

Features
- Input budget and land area constraints
- Add multiple tree species with individual characteristics
- Optimize for carbon sequestration and biodiversity
- View detailed results including tree counts and environmental impact
- Mobile-friendly interface

Demo
[Include a link to the live demo once it's deployed on GitHub Pages]
