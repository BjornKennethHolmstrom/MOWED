# MOWED: Mission, roadmap, and sustainability

## Mission
MOWED (Mathematical Optimization With End-user Devices) is committed to democratizing access to optimization tools. Powerful mathematical optimization should be accessible to everyone, from students and researchers to small business owners and individual problem-solvers.

## Core principles
1. Provide free access to basic optimization tools
2. Maintain transparency in our operations and development
3. Prioritize user value and education
4. Ensure project sustainability while keeping core features free

## What is offered
- Free, open-source optimization tools that run directly in your web browser
- A user-friendly interface for various optimization problems
- Educational resources to help you understand and apply optimization techniques

## Project Roadmap
1. Current phase: Development and release of free core product
   - Implementing basic optimization modules
   - Refining user interface and experience
   - Building community and gathering user feedback

2. Future plans:
   - Expand range of optimization modules
   - Enhance data visualization capabilities
   - Explore advanced features for complex problems

3. Long-term vision: Custom Solver Development
   As part of the commitment to advancing the field of optimization and providing cutting-edge tools to users, we have plans to develop custom optimization solvers. These solvers will aim to:
   - Improve performance for specific types of optimization problems
   - Leverage modern web technologies for efficient browser-based computation
   - Provide open-source alternatives to commercial solvers
   
   This initiative is in its early conceptual stages and will evolve based on user needs, technological advancements, and research developments in the field of optimization.

## Sustainability model

### Current funding
MOWED relies on community support to sustain its development:

1. **Donations**: If you find MOWED valuable, consider "buying us a coffee" through our donation system. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps us cover server costs and development time.

2. **Educational Support**: MOWED is and will remain free for educational use. We believe in investing in the next generation of problem-solvers and optimizers.

### Future considerations
To ensure long-term sustainability while keeping our core tools free, we may explore:

- Optional cloud-based services for complex, resource-intensive problems
- Custom module development for specialized needs
- Consulting services for advanced optimization challenges

These potential services will always be optional, with our core tools remaining free and open-source.

## How the support helps
The donations directly contribute to:
- Maintaining and improving the free tools
- Developing new optimization modules
- Covering operational costs (e.g., servers, domain registration)
- Creating educational content and resources

## The commitment
We pledge to:
- Keep our core optimization tools free and open-source
- Continuously improve and expand our offerings
- Provide clear updates on how contributions are used to improve MOWED
- Maintain transparency in our operations and decision-making

Thank you for being part of the MOWED community and supporting our mission to make optimization accessible to all!
