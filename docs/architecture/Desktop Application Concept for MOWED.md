# Web Application Concept for MOWED

Core Application:
- Web-based application
- Cross-platform (runs in modern web browsers)
- Built with Vue.js and Vite
- Uses Chart.js for visualization
- Runs all optimizations locally in the user's browser

Features:
- User-friendly interface for inputting optimization parameters
- Local storage of scenarios and results using browser's localStorage
- Visualization of optimization results using Chart.js
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new optimization problems

Distribution:
- Accessible via web browser
- Can be hosted on static file hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- Open-source, allowing community to understand and learn from the code

Benefits:
- No ongoing server costs for core functionality
- Users have full access to all features
- Can work offline after initial load (as a Progressive Web App)
- Transparent codebase for educational purposes

Challenges:
- Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers
- Managing application updates and versioning
- Balancing feature complexity with browser performance

Future Expansion:
- Implementation of more optimization modules
- Enhanced data visualization options
- Potential for optional cloud integration for data sharing or more complex computations

Funding (if needed):
- Voluntary donations
- Grants for educational technology
- Sponsorships from aligned organizations (without affecting free access)
