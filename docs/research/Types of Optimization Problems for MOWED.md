Types of Optimization Problems for MOWED

Linear Programming (LP)

-Objective function and constraints are linear
-Suitable for resource allocation, production planning, etc.

Quadratic Programming (QP)

-Objective function is quadratic, constraints are linear
-Useful for portfolio optimization, certain control problems

Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)

-Some variables are restricted to integer values
-Applicable to scheduling, facility location problems

Nonlinear Programming (NLP)

-Objective function or constraints are nonlinear
-Covers a wide range of real-world problems

Convex Optimization

-Special case where the objective function is convex
-Includes many practical problems and often easier to solve globally

Global Optimization

-Finding the absolute best solution in non-convex problems
-Challenging but important for many engineering and scientific applications

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

-Focus on finding a feasible solution satisfying all constraints
-Useful in configuration, planning, and scheduling problems

These categories represent a range of problem types. For a small-scale, end-user focused application, you might want to start with a subset of these, perhaps focusing on LP, QP, and simple NLP problems initially.

2. Problem Size Limitations:
Given that MOWED is intended for end-user devices, we need to define what "small-scale" means. This could be in terms of:
- Number of variables (e.g., up to 100-1000)
- Number of constraints (e.g., up to 50-500)
- Computation time (e.g., solutions should be found within seconds or a few minutes at most). An hour or two might be ok but no more.

3. Target User Base:
Consider who would benefit most from this tool:
- Students learning optimization
- Engineers or scientists doing quick calculations
- Business analysts performing simple modeling tasks
- Researchers prototyping ideas before moving to larger scale

4. Device Compatibility:
- Web browsers (for maximum compatibility)
- Mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- Desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux)

5. User Interface Complexity:
- Basic: Simple input forms for well-defined problem types
- Intermediate: Ability to write simple algebraic expressions
- Advanced: Support for importing data and custom scripting

6. Integration Capabilities:
- Data import/export (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- API for programmatic access
- Potential for plugin system for custom solvers or problem types

7. Output and Visualization:
- Numerical results
- Basic charts and graphs
- Sensitivity analysis
- Solution interpretation assistance


8. Computation Time Management:

-Primarily aim for quick solutions (seconds to minutes) for most problems.
-Allow for extended computation times (up to 1-2 hours) for complex problems.
-Implement a system to detect potentially long-running computations and provide clear warnings to users.
-Offer options for users to:
  a) Proceed with the long computation
  b) Adjust problem parameters to potentially reduce computation time
  c) Save the problem setup and schedule the computation for a convenient time
-Provide progress indicators and estimated completion times for longer computations.
-Allow users to interrupt and resume long-running computations when possible.

Considerations for Extended Computation Times

Problem Complexity Detection:

Develop heuristics to estimate computation time based on problem size, type, and complexity.
Use these estimates to trigger appropriate warnings and user options.


User Notifications:

Implement a system to notify users when long-running computations are complete, especially on mobile devices.


Battery and Resource Management:

For mobile devices, warn users about potential battery drain and suggest connecting to a power source.
Provide options to pause computations if device resources (battery, memory, etc.) become constrained.


Result Caching and Incremental Solutions:

Where applicable, cache intermediate results to allow for quick previews or partial solutions.
Implement algorithms that can provide incremental improvements, allowing users to stop the computation early if a "good enough" solution is found.


Parallel Processing:

Explore options for utilizing multi-core processors or GPU acceleration for complex problems, when available on the user's device.


Problem Simplification Suggestions:

Offer guidance on how to simplify or approximate complex problems to reduce computation time, while still providing valuable insights.


Educational Opportunity:

Use long-running computations as an opportunity to educate users about the nature of complex optimization problems and the trade-offs between solution quality and computation time.

By defining these aspects, we can start to shape the project's scope. It's important to note that you may want to start with a more limited scope for an initial version and expand as you get user feedback and gain more insights into user needs.
