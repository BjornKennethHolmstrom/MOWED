# MOWED Detailed Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current Phase)

### Development Environment Setup
- [x] Set up Vue.js project with Vite
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- [x] Set up version control (Git) and create GitHub repository
- [x] Review and update Vite, ESLint, Prettier, and Babel configurations
- [x] Configure continuous integration (CI) pipeline
- [x] Review and organize existing test setup (Jest and Cypress)

### Core Architecture and Module System
- [x] Design and implement ModuleInterface base class
- [x] Create basic plugin system for module integration
- [x] Implement module loading mechanism
- [x] Integrate ModuleRegistry with the Vuex store
- [x] Enhance ModuleSelector component to use ModuleRegistry
- [x] Implement a consistent way to register modules at startup
- [x] Create a system for module-specific state management
- [X] Implement error handling and validation in the module system
- [x] Document the module system and provide examples for creating new modules

### Basic UI Framework
- [x] Create main App component structure
- [x] Implement ModuleSelector component
- [x] Design and implement basic layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
- [x] Create placeholder components for each planned module

### Data Model and Persistence Layer
- [x] Design generic data model structure
- [x] Implement data abstraction layer
  - [x] Create interface for data operations (CRUD)
  - [x] Implement LocalStorage adapter
  - [X] Implement IndexedDB adapter
- [x] Set up Vuex store for global state management

### Personal Finance Module (Basic Version)
- [x] Design data model for Personal Finance module
- [x] Implement basic input form for financial data
- [x] Create simple optimization algorithm for financial calculations
- [x] Develop results display component

### Event System Architecture
- [x] Design event system with consideration for future P2P events
- [X] Implement basic event emission and subscription mechanism

## Beginning of Phase 2: Core Functionality

### State Management System
- [x] Extend Vuex store for module-specific states
- [x] Implement actions and mutations for data updates
- [x] Design state structure with potential distributed systems in mind

### Offline Capabilities
- [X] Set up service worker for basic offline functionality
- [X] Implement a strategy for storing and syncing data when offline
- [X] Handle cases where the app needs to make API calls when offline
- [X] Provide appropriate UI feedback when the app is offline
- [X] Implement caching strategy for application assets
- [X] Create mechanism for offline data storage and sync

### Testing Framework
- [x] Set up Jest for unit testing
- [x] Configure Cypress for end-to-end testing
- [ ] Write initial test suite for existing components and functions

### Small Business Management Module
- [x] Design data model for Small Business Management module
- [x] Create input forms for business data
- [x] Implement basic business optimization algorithms
- [ ] Develop results visualization for business insights

### Enhancements to Personal Finance Module
- [ ] Add more complex financial calculations
- [ ] Implement data visualization for financial insights
- [ ] Create "what-if" scenario functionality

### Additional Modules
