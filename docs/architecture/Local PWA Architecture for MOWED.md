# Local PWA Architecture for MOWED

Components:
1. HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend using Vue.js
2. Vite as the build tool and development server
3. Vuex for state management
4. Chart.js for data visualization

How it works:
1. User visits the MOWED website
2. The browser downloads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
3. When the user inputs data and clicks "Optimize":
   - The optimization logic (currently in JavaScript) performs the calculations
   - Results are stored in Vuex state and displayed using Vue components
   - Visualization is handled by Chart.js

Hosting requirements:
- Static file hosting only (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- No need for a backend server

Benefits:
- No server-side computation required
- Works offline after initial load (when implemented as a full PWA)
- Can be installed as a PWA on devices
- Very low hosting costs (potentially free)

Challenges:
- Implementing complex optimization algorithms in JavaScript
- Balancing feature complexity with application performance
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers and devices

Future Considerations:
- Implementing service workers for full offline functionality
- Exploring WebAssembly for more complex optimization algorithms
- Potential integration of Python libraries like PuLP using Pyodide (as initially planned)
